1.) Description of the problem and Discussion of background:
Description of problem:
New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhood. This we already know looking into modules.
Need to introduce the context of the capstone skills and scenario.
First we will look into what are requirements to open the restaurant and then we will look into the recommendations.

Requirements:
1.	How can you make your new restaurant stand out from the crowd?
2.	Choose your concept
3.	Research your target market 
4.	Plan your restaurant design and layout.
5.	Plan for equipment and supplies

Recommendations:
•	Within the basic categories of restaurants — fast food or quick-service restaurants, casual restaurants or fine dining establishments — there are innumerable variations. Your choice of concept will be shaped by your interests, target market and budget, as well as current culinary trends. Not every concept will work in every community. Research your market to determine if there’s a demand for the type of restaurant you want to start. If you have your heart set on an upscale French restaurant, but your area is mostly working-class families with young children, for instance, there’s probably not a big enough market to support your concept. Also, consider the local competition and what they aren’t offering that you could provide.
•	Your budget restricts your concept to some extent. If you're on a tight budget, consider a limited-service concept, such as a breakfast café open in the mornings and early afternoons, or a sandwich shop open at lunchtime. If you have more capital, you have more options.

Carefully research your target market. Ask yourself:
•	Who are your desired customers? What are their demographics (household income, disposable income, age, marital status, location, occupation, etc.)?
•	Where do they currently go out to eat (in other words, what restaurants are your competitors)? How often do they go out to eat?
•	How will you differentiate your business from the restaurants they’re currently patronizing?
•	What prices are they willing to pay?
•	Is there a sufficient customer base to support your concept, both now and in the future?
Once your concept is established, start planning your restaurant space. In addition to the main dining area, you'll need room for:
•	Kitchen/food preparation and staging
•	Staff area (for breaks and meals)
•	Restrooms
•	Waiting area for customers
•	Food and beverage storage
•	Storage for dishware, silver, linens, etc.
•	Bar, if desired
•	Outdoor patio, if desired
•	If you want to offer takeout, delivery or curbside pickup, factor in space for those needs, including short-term parking space near the restaurant.
You may need specialized equipment, such as a wood-burning pizza oven, depending on your concept. However, every restaurant needs:
?	Refrigeration unit
?	Stove/oven/grill
?	Dishwasher
?	Icemaker
?	Cookware/utensils
?	Bar equipment (beer taps, refrigerators, ice bins)
?	Tables/chairs/booths
?	Sound system for music
?	Flooring
?	Wall decor/window coverings
?	Lighting
?	Glassware, dishware, silverware, linens (or paper/plastic equivalents for a quick-serve or casual restaurant)
?	Staff uniforms

Finally Important is Leasing may make more financial sense than buying, especially if the lease includes maintenance on the equipment. In general, equipment that has a short lifespan or is frequently updated should be leased. You can save big by purchasing used equipment, furniture and cookware. Find used restaurant equipment on eBay or by searching for used equipment or going-out-of-business sales near you.

2.) •	Contracting can be a lucrative career opportunity, but failing to establish the proper business entities, systems, and structures could mean setting yourself up for failure. It’s important to establish a formal business entity that can grow with your business before taking on clients, so that you can focus your attention on providing excellent services instead of frantically trying to wrap up loose legal ends.
•	But understanding the legal nuances of setting up a formal business structure is not an easy task. There are decisions to make, such as the choosing the right legal structure for your company, and such decisions depend on factors such as whether you’ll be a sole proprietor or eventually hire staff, among others. Coupled with the myriad of paperwork that is necessary to form a business entity, this is no simple task for someone just starting out in business with no legal or accounting expertise.
•	leverage location data to solve a problem or to get deeper insights into a neighborhoods for office room locations and Location data is data describing places and venues, such as their geographical location, their category, working hours, full address, and so on, such that for a given location given in the form of its geographical coordinates (or latitude and longitude values) one is able to determine what types of venues exist within a defined radius from that location
•	Decide on Business Legal type
•	Apply for TAX ID No and other tax Registrations
•	Register your Business Name 
•	Setup Business Checking system and Business record keeping system
